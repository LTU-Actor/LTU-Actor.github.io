## ACTor

ACTor (**A**utonomous **C**ampus **T**ransp**or**t) is an ongoing research
project at [Lawrence Technological University](ltu.edu) to develop an
Autonomous Campus Taxi framework. Currently we are using
[ROS](http://www.ros.org/) (Robot Operating System) on a [Polaris GEM
e2](http://www.polaris.com/en-us/gem-electric-car/e2)

*ACTor completion various tasks during the 2018 [IGVC](http://www.igvc.org/) competition*

### Sponsors

Creating this research platform would not have been possible without our
sponsors. [Hundai Mobis](http://www.mobistc-na.com/) and
[Dataspeed](http://dataspeedinc.com/) are working together to provide our team
with the drive by wire Gem2, and [Veoneer](https://www.veoneer.com/) has
provided our primary lidar and radar systems.

## More Information

We try our best to keep the software as simple as possible. Nevertheless, as an
autonomous vehicle platform it does get complicated. You can find all our
software from the 2019 year on our [Github](https://github.com/LTU-Actor)
